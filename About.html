 <strong>Hi everyone,</strong> I'm Zahraa Ali a 19 year old computer science & cybersecurity student who plays as a goalkeeper for Bahrain women national football team .Starting with something I have such big passion and love for wasn’t that easy ,I started playing a lone since I was 9 years old at home just kicking the ball around who would have thought that this 9 year old will be playing one an international level now.

When I started, I had to face Society and some cultural rules sometimes, but this didn’t stop me because my passion was bigger, I didn’t find a place to train till I found an academy and this academy played in the women league.

  <strong>On the other hand,</strong> I used to play as a midfielder but our team most of the time didn’t have a goalie so the coach would play me in goal even though at that time i was short ,young and a bit chubby . We played a big game in the league against Riffa and their players are the national team women players which are very hard to compete with despite our loss against them I saved a lot during this game which impressed the managers of the national , After few weeks I get a letter from the national team that say’s that the coaches wants to see me train and I went to training and been chosen to be a part of under 14 national team . We had a (West Asia tournament in UAE )and i only have been training with the national team as a goalie for 2 months only.

<p>
  <strong>After </strong>we’re done with the tournament I got chosen for (best goalie award) and from that day I chose to be a goalie, had another (West Asia tournament in Bahrain for Under 18 2019-2020) and got best goalie. Lastly ,my recent one I’m playing with the First national team we had a (Futsal West Asia tournament in Saudi) I played every match and Conceded only 1 goal in the tournament and got (Best goalie Award).

<p>
  <strong>It's not as easy</strong> as it looks, I had to control my social life and my study which isn’t easy ,had to lose some weight and make extra effort to make sure I’m doing everything I can to be the best for my team and myself. At the end it’s all in Ur hands and u make the difference u want.
